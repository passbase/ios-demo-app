Please follow our integration guide in our [official developer documentation](https://docs.passbase.com/ios) to install all dependencies first in a correct way.

2. Open the the file `Passbase Demo App.xcworkspace`
3. Go into the `Appdelegate.swift` file and exchange `YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY` with your own API key in line 19.
